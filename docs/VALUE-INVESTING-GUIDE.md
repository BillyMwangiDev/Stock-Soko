# Value Investing Guide for Beginners

## What is Value Investing?

**Simple Definition**: Buying good companies when they're on sale.

Think of it like shopping:
- Would you pay KES 1,000 for something worth KES 600? No!
- Would you pay KES 600 for something worth KES 1,000? Yes!

Value investing applies this same logic to stocks.

## The Three Core Principles

### 1. Margin of Safety (Your Protection)

**What it means**: Don't pay full price - buy at a big discount.

**Formula**:
```
Margin of Safety = (True Worth - Current Price) / True Worth × 100%
```

**Example**:
- Stock's true worth: KES 100
- Current price: KES 70
- Margin of safety: 30%

**NSE Rule**: Aim for 30-50% discount (Kenyan market is volatile)

**Why it matters**: Protects you if your analysis is slightly wrong.

### 2. Intrinsic Value (True Worth)

**What it means**: What the business is actually worth (ignore market price).

**Simple Methods**:

**Method 1: Book Value**
```
Book Value = Total Assets - Total Liabilities
```
Example: Assets KES 500B, Liabilities KES 450B = Worth KES 50B

**Method 2: Earnings Multiple**
```
Fair Value = Earnings per Share × Reasonable P/E
```
Example: EPS KES 10, Fair P/E 10 = Worth KES 100/share

**Method 3: Dividend Approach**
```
Fair Value = Annual Dividend / Required Return
```
Example: Dividend KES 4, Want 12% return = Worth KES 33

### 3. Economic Moat (Protection from Competition)

**What it means**: Like a castle moat - keeps competitors away.

**Kenya Examples**:

| Moat Type | Example | Why It Helps |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **License** | Banking license | Only 40 banks allowed, hard to get new license |
| **Brand** | Tusker beer (EABL) | Customers loyal, hard to change habits |
| **Network** | Bank branches | KCB has 250+ branches, expensive to build |
| **Scale** | Safaricom | 30M+ customers, smaller competitor can't match |

**Check**: Could a new company easily compete? If NO = good moat.

## Simple Value Screening (5-Minute Check)

### Quick Checklist

For any NSE stock, check these 8 things:

1. **P/E Ratio < 15?** (Lower = cheaper)
   - Bargain: P/E < 8
   - Reasonable: P/E 8-15
   - Expensive: P/E > 15

2. **P/B Ratio < 1.5?** (Paying near or below book value)
   - Great: P/B < 1.0
   - Good: P/B 1.0-1.5
   - Expensive: P/B > 2.0

3. **ROE > 12% for 5 years?** (Consistent profitability)
   - Excellent: ROE > 15%
   - Good: ROE 10-15%
   - Poor: ROE < 10%

4. **Debt/Equity < 0.7?** (Not too much debt)
   - Low risk: <0.5
   - Moderate: 0.5-1.0
   - High risk: >1.0

5. **Positive Free Cash Flow?** (Actually making cash)
   - Must be positive
   - Check last 3 years

6. **Daily Volume > KES 500,000?** (Can you buy and sell?)
   - Excellent: >KES 1M
   - OK: >KES 500K
   - Warning: <KES 500K

7. **Can you explain the business?** (Simplicity test)
   - If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it

8. **Does it have a moat?** (Competitive advantage)
   - License, brand, network, or scale

**Result**: If 6+ boxes checked → Do deep analysis  
**If <6** → Skip and move to next stock

 Price reaches fair value (no more discount)  
 Business fundamentals deteriorating  
 Found much better opportunity  
 Your original analysis was wrong

### DON'T SELL When:
 Price drops but business still good  
 Media is negative (often wrong)  
 Market is down generally  
 One bad quarter (if long-term intact)

## Real NSE Example (Simplified)

### Stock: Example Banking Stock

**Current Price**: KES 28  
**Analysis**:
- Book Value per share: KES 40
- P/B Ratio: 28/40 = 0.7 (below 1.0 = good!)
- ROE: 18% (excellent for a bank)
- P/E: 6 (bank average is 10 = cheap!)
- Debt: Moderate, well-managed
- Moat: Banking license, 200+ branches
- Dividend: KES 3/share = 10.7% yield (high!)

**Intrinsic Value Estimate**: KES 45
**Margin of Safety**: (45-28)/45 = 38% 

**Decision**: STRONG BUY
- Trading at big discount
- Quality business with moat
- Good liquidity
- Hold for 3-5 years, target KES 45+

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Value Trap
**Mistake**: Buying cheap stock with dying business  
**Example**: P/E 5 but revenue declining 3 years  
**Lesson**: Cheap can get cheaper if business is broken

### 2. Ignoring Liquidity
**Mistake**: Buying stock with only KES 100K daily volume  
**Problem**: Can't sell when you want to  
**Lesson**: Check volume before buying

### 3. No Margin of Safety
**Mistake**: Buying at "fair value" (no discount)  
**Problem**: No room for error  
**Lesson**: Require 30%+ discount always

### 4. Too Concentrated
**Mistake**: Putting 50% in one stock  
**Risk**: One mistake = huge loss  
**Lesson**: Maximum 10% per stock

### 5. Impatient
**Mistake**: Selling after 6 months if price doesn't move  
**Reality**: Value takes 2-3 years to materialize  
**Lesson**: Think 3-5 year minimum
