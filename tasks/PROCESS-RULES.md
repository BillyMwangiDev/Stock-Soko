# Project Process Rules: PRD and Task List Generation

This document captures the user's required workflow for generating Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and implementation Task Lists. These rules are authoritative and must be followed across the project.

## Rule: Generating a Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Goal
To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) in Markdown format, based on an initial user prompt. The PRD should be clear, actionable, and suitable for a junior developer to understand and implement the feature.

### Process
1. Receive Initial Prompt: The user provides a brief description or request for a new feature or functionality.
2. Ask Clarifying Questions: Before writing the PRD, the AI must ask clarifying questions to gather sufficient detail. The goal is to understand the "what" and "why" of the feature, not necessarily the "how" (which the developer will figure out). Make sure to provide options in letter/number lists so the user can respond easily with selections.
3. Generate PRD: Based on the initial prompt and the user's answers to the clarifying questions, generate a PRD using the structure outlined below.
4. Save PRD: Save the generated document as `[n]-prd-[feature-name].md` inside the `/tasks` directory. (Where n is a zero-padded 4-digit sequence starting from 0001, e.g., `0001-prd-user-authentication.md`, `0002-prd-dashboard.md`, etc.)

### Clarifying Questions (Examples)
The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are some common areas to explore:
- Problem/Goal: "What problem does this feature solve for the user?" or "What is the main goal we want to achieve with this feature?"
- Target User: "Who is the primary user of this feature?"
- Core Functionality: "Can you describe the key actions a user should be able to perform with this feature?"
- User Stories: "Could you provide a few user stories? (e.g., As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [benefit].)"
- Acceptance Criteria: "How will we know when this feature is successfully implemented? What are the key success criteria?"
- Scope/Boundaries: "Are there any specific things this feature should not do (non-goals)?"
- Data Requirements: "What kind of data does this feature need to display or manipulate?"
- Design/UI: "Are there any existing design mockups or UI guidelines to follow?" or "Can you describe the desired look and feel?"
- Edge Cases: "Are there any potential edge cases or error conditions we should consider?"

### PRD Structure
The generated PRD should include the following sections:
1. Introduction/Overview: Briefly describe the feature and the problem it solves. State the goal.
2. Goals: List the specific, measurable objectives for this feature.
3. User Stories: Detail the user narratives describing feature usage and benefits.
4. Functional Requirements: List the specific functionalities the feature must have. Use clear, concise language (e.g., "The system must allow users to upload a profile picture."). Number these requirements.
5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope): Clearly state what this feature will not include to manage scope.
6. Design Considerations (Optional): Link to mockups, describe UI/UX requirements, or mention relevant components/styles if applicable.
7. Technical Considerations (Optional): Mention any known technical constraints, dependencies, or suggestions (e.g., "Should integrate with the existing Auth module").
8. Success Metrics: How will the success of this feature be measured? (e.g., "Increase user engagement by 10%", "Reduce support tickets related to X").
9. Open Questions: List any remaining questions or areas needing further clarification.

### Target Audience
Assume the primary reader of the PRD is a junior developer. Therefore, requirements should be explicit, unambiguous, and avoid jargon where possible. Provide enough detail for them to understand the feature's purpose and core logic.

### Output
- Format: Markdown (.md)
- Location: `/tasks/`
- Filename: `[n]-prd-[feature-name].md`

### Final instructions
1. Do NOT start implementing the PRD
2. Make sure to ask the user clarifying questions
3. Take the user's answers to the clarifying questions and improve the PRD

## Rule: Generating a Task List from a PRD

### Goal
To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step task list in Markdown format based on an existing Product Requirements Document (PRD). The task list should guide a developer through implementation.

### Output
- Format: Markdown (.md)
- Location: `/tasks/`
- Filename: `tasks-[prd-file-name].md` (e.g., `tasks-0001-prd-user-profile-editing.md`)

### Process
1. Receive PRD Reference: The user points the AI to a specific PRD file
2. Analyze PRD: The AI reads and analyzes the functional requirements, user stories, and other sections of the specified PRD.
3. Assess Current State: Review the existing codebase to understand existing infrastructure, architectural patterns and conventions. Also, identify any existing components or features that already exist and could be relevant to the PRD requirements. Then, identify existing related files, components, and utilities that can be leveraged or need modification.
4. Phase 1: Generate Parent Tasks: Based on the PRD analysis and current state assessment, create the file and generate the main, high-level tasks required to implement the feature. Use your judgement on how many high-level tasks to use. It's likely to be about five tasks. Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet). Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level tasks based on the PRD. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
5. Wait for Confirmation: Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
6. Phase 2: Generate Sub-Tasks: Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary to complete the parent task. Ensure sub-tasks logically follow from the parent task, cover the implementation details implied by the PRD, and consider existing codebase patterns where relevant without being constrained by them.
7. Identify Relevant Files: Based on the tasks and PRD, identify potential files that will need to be created or modified. List these under the Relevant Files section, including corresponding test files if applicable.
8. Generate Final Output: Combine the parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes into the final Markdown structure.
9. Save Task List: Save the generated document in the `/tasks/` directory with the filename `tasks-[prd-file-name].md`, where `[prd-file-name]` matches the base name of the input PRD file (e.g., if the input was `0001-prd-user-profile-editing.md`, the output is `tasks-0001-prd-user-profile-editing.md`).

### Output Format
The generated task list must follow this structure:

## Relevant Files

- `path/to/potential/file1.ts` - Brief description of why this file is relevant (e.g., Contains the main component for this feature).
- `path/to/file1.test.ts` - Unit tests for `file1.ts`.
- `path/to/another/file.tsx` - Brief description (e.g., API route handler for data submission).
- `path/to/another/file.test.tsx` - Unit tests for `another/file.tsx`.
- `lib/utils/helpers.ts` - Brief description (e.g., Utility functions needed for calculations).
- `lib/utils/helpers.test.ts` - Unit tests for `helpers.ts`.

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 1.1 [Sub-task description 1.1]
  - [ ] 1.2 [Sub-task description 1.2]
- [ ] 2.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 2.1 [Sub-task description 2.1]
- [ ] 3.0 Parent Task Title (may not require sub-tasks if purely structural or configuration)

### Interaction Model
The process explicitly requires a pause after generating parent tasks to get user confirmation ("Go") before proceeding to generate the detailed sub-tasks. This ensures the high-level plan aligns with user expectations before diving into details.

### Target Audience
Assume the primary reader of the task list is a junior developer who will implement the feature with awareness of the existing codebase context.

## Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

### Task Implementation
- One sub-task at a time: Do NOT start the next sub task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- Completion protocol:
  1. When you finish a sub task, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
  2. If all subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, follow this sequence:
     - First: Run the full test suite (pytest, npm test, bin/rails test, etc.)
     - Only if all tests pass: Stage changes (`git add .`)
     - Clean up: Remove any temporary files and temporary code before committing
     - Commit: Use a descriptive commit message that:
       - Uses conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, refactor:, etc.)
       - Summarizes what was accomplished in the parent task
       - Lists key changes and additions
       - References the task number and PRD context
       - Formats the message as a single-line command using -m flags, e.g.:
         - `git commit -m "feat: add payment validation logic" -m "- Validates card type and expiry" -m "- Adds unit tests for edge cases" -m "Related to T123 in PRD"`
  3. Once all the subtasks are marked completed and changes have been committed, mark the parent task as completed.
- Stop after each sub task and wait for the user's go ahead.

### Task List Maintenance
1. Update the task list as you work:
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.
2. Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one line description of its purpose.

### AI Instructions
When working with task lists, the AI must:
1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished sub task `[x]`.
   - Mark the parent task `[x]` once all its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub task is next.
6. After implementing a sub task, update the file and then pause for user approval.
